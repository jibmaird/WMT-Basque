Chagas: an emerging disease.
Introduction. The Chagas disease or American tripanosomiasis, which is transmited by
bugs, is the parasitary disease with the higher tases of morbi-mortality in America. Due

principally to the increase of the migratory dinamics, the disease has spread to non en-
demic areas.

Objetives. Provide an updated view of Chagas disease in the Basque Country and analyze
the resource consumption of this health problem.

Methodology. An observational, descriptive and retrospective study. The data was ob-
tained from the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS). There were collected the hospital ad-
missions from 2010 to 2015 with diagnosis of infection by Tripanosoma cruzi in public

hospitals of the Basque Country. The study population was 104 patients, out of a total
of 140 admissions. The variables studied are main and secondary diagnosis, sex, age,
country of birth, and province and section of hospital admission.

Results. Regarding diagnosis, 82 have no organ involvement, 15 have cardiac involve-
ment, 5 have involvement of another organ and 2 have cardiac and other organ invol-
vement. Only in 10 patients Chagas' disease was the main diagnosis. In 31 women the

admission section was Gynecology and Obstetrics. There is a statistically significant diffe-
rence between the sexes (85 women and 19 men). There is no association between sex

and Chagas disease with organic involvement. 68 patients are in the age group 30-49
years. Bolivia is the country of origin of 63 patients. The total cost of income is 761,636â‚¬.

Conclusions. Chagas disease is a global health problem, which is gaining sufficient rele-
vance in our environment. Therefore, care strategies should be carried out for the de-
tection of new cases and the control and follow-up of diagnosed cases.
