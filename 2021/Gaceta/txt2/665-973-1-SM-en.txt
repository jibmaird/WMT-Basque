Contribution of the medicinal use of cannabis derivatives: a review of their potential clinical efficacy and risks.

The use of cannabis derivatives as therapeutic agents raises today a broad scientific and

social debate. There are some synthetic cannabis derivatives approved by drug regula-
tory agencies with clinical indications such as nausea and vomiting in cancer patients,

or pain treatment among the most important.
The objective of the work is the review, based on current scientific knowledge, of the
potential therapeutic use, in terms of clinical efficacy and safety, of cannabis derivatives

in different clinical situations, especially associated with the treatment of pain, basic tre-
atment and / or coadjuvant in cancerous processes, as well as treatment of neurological

and psychiatric diseases.
For all these areas, at the present time, clinical research on the use of natural or synthetic
cannabis derivatives is scarce, so it is recommended to promote it with controlled clinical
studies according to the regulations of international drug regulatory agencies. It should
be studies that, in addition to providing knowledge on the efficacy and safety of these
products, demonstrate the most effective form of administration for therapeutic use,
the most appropriate active components (Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol),
and the clinical impact of its association with other drugs.
In conclusion, only the increase in scientific knowledge of the therapeutic properties of
cannabis derivatives can help their legalization for medicinal purposes.
