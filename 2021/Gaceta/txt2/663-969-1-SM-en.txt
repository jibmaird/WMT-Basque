Spiritual care at the end of life. Intervention by health professionals
Abstract:
Objectives: This article is about spiritual care at end of life, delving into palliative care.

Spiritual field is important throughout the whole biography, because it supposes an in-
nate and necessary search of the meaning of life. Nevertheless, it specially takes on im-
portance when death is close and difficult questions come up. The main goal is to

emphasise the importance of spiritual sphere at the end of life and to know the tools
for evaluation and treatment of spiritual suffering.

Methodology: A bibliographic revision was made in different scientific data bases (Pub-
Med, ScienceDirect) about the following issues: Death in actual society and medicine,

spiritual needs at end of life, tools for detection, evaluation and treatment.

Results: Quite a lot of tools have been developed for detection, evaluation and treat-
ment of spiritual needs, but education and awareness is needed among professionals.

Amongst these tools the one proposed by GES stands out. It is a simple, short and sen-
sitive survey for evaluating spiritual sphere, which has also a therapeutic use. Working

on this field is beneficial for the patient if it is done in individualised way.
Conclusions: Highlight is made on working on the process of dying in actual society,

with a direct effect on assistance at the end of life. Considering spiritual needs that ap-
pear in this last phase is needed to offer integral assistance. Education is required in this
process.
