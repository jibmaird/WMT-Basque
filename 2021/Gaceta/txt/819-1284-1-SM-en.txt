The 1918 flu pandemic in the child population of Bilbao 
Abstract: 
The 1918 flu pandemic did not affect the entire population equally. Drawing on the Bil bao Municipal Statistics Bulletins (1917-1920) as main source, an epidemiological study  has been conducted to determine the impact left by this pandemic on crude mortality  rate (CMR) for children (0 to 14 years) in this town. Evidence shows a significant increase  in infant mortality. Only in 1918, the CMR due to influenza rose to 6.72 per 1000, com pared to 0.68 per 1000 in 1917. In addition, it has been confirmed that the pandemic  does not affect boys and girls differently based on their sex.
