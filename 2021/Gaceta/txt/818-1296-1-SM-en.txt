The second wave of the 1918 pandemic flu in Irun in the press
Abstract:
Due to its status as a border city, Irún especially suffered from the 1918 epidemic flu.
Specifically, the second wave, which arrived at its doors from France in September,
thanks to the heavy traffic of Portuguese soldiers and seasonal workers.
However, in the local press, initially, the disease has not importance, which occupies
minimal space and in areas of less interest until after the death peak, on September 21

and 22. It is in early October when the pandemic receives the most attention. Informa-
tion articles are published on the preventive measures put in place, and other popular

articles on basic aspects, such as the good disposition of the room for sick people.
The absence of local information about the flu and the concealment of its terrible
effects in the city of Irún is striking.
In November, the people most involved in the social and health struggle are thanked

for their work, and initiatives are cited to alleviate the effects, but interest in the epide-
mic soon waned, cornered in the press by the end of the First World War.
