How is the distribution of automatic external defibrillators in Euskadi?
Abstract:
The adequate use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) has shown its efficacy in
the improvement of survival and neurological prognosis in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
Spanish legislation requires the placement of these devices in certain places with a large
influx of public. With the present work we wanted to analyze what is its distribution in
Euskadi, and if it was adjusted to the population of each of its provinces. At the time of
carrying out this study, a total of 1711 DEAs have been counted in Euskadi, although
there is no homogeneous distribution between Vizcaya, Guipúzcoa and Álava.
