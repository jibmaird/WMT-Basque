Pharmaceutical dispensing in Bizkaia during the spanish flu pandemic 
Abstract: 
The Aramburu Pharmacy Museum preserves all prescription books used since its ope ning in January 1888. For this reason, we have been able to keep track of the therapeu tic treatments applied to patients with Spanish flu in 1918. Furthermore, the Civil Regis try office in Plentzia has provided us with data corresponding to the aforementioned  
period of time. 
Therefore, we become aware of the transformation undergone by medication, which at  first was produced at the pharmacy itself - in the form of magistral formulas or officinal  preparations - and thereafter went into industrial production by emerging European  or North American pharmaceutical laboratories: specific medication or pharmaceutical  specialties.
