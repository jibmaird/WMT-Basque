The rol of the physical therapists as integated professional in resuscitation/inten-
sive care units

Abstract:
In the majority of the developed countries, physical therapists play a very important role
within the multidisciplinary teams of intensive care Units (ICU). In such countries, the
role of physiotherapists in ICUs is strongly encouraged and defended by reanimation
societies, like the Society of Physiotherapists of Intensive Care Units (SKR) or the SRLF in
France. However, this is not the case in the Basque Healthcare Service Osakidetza, where
there are no physiotherapists whatsoever integrated in resuscitation units.
There is strong evidence3, 4, 10, 12 of the presence of physical therapists in ICUs having a
direct effect on the shortening of the mechanical ventilation time and the hospital stay
of patients, resulting in reduced economical expenses for healthcare services. Given the
vast literature regarding the benefits of physiotherapy in ICUs, healthcare systems not

following the recommendations of international experts should reconsider the integra-
tion of physiotherapists in the staff of reanimation services, which allows the creation

of early mobilization programs aimed at preventing complications linked to prolonged
immobilization as well as the negative consequences of Mechanical Ventilation (VM ).

The rehabilitation of patients in these units requires the acquisition of very specific kno-
wledge in respiratory physiotherapy, as well as good communication skills and technical

rigour to ensure maximum quality rehabilitation, always respecting safety parameters
and the patient's autonomy principles.
