Stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) in localized non-small cell lung carcinoma (CNMP)
Abstract:
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as a treatment for early stage
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly for patients who are unable to tolerate

surgical resection, and possibly as an alternative to surgery for some appropriately se-
lected patients. Data from numerous retrospective studies and clinical trials have de-
monstrated that SBRT is a safe and effective treatment, with results rivaling those of

surgical resection, for early NSCLC.
