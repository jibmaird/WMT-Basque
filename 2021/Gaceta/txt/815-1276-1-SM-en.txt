1918 influenza microbiology: from Pfeifferâ€™s bacillus to the reconstruction of
virus A H1N1 in cadavers in permafrost.
Abstract:
After 100 years of the flu pandemic of 1918, also called the Spanish flu, and in the face

of a new viral pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus, it is necessary and ti-
mely to carry out an analysis of the main historical milestones of this major disease. The

study of the virus that caused the 1918 flu pandemic has resulted in one of the most
exciting stories in modern microbiology. The objective of this paper is to gain a deeper

understanding of the revolutionary research work that led to the discovery, comple-
te genome sequencing, and genetic reconstruction of the 1918 influenza virus, which

may help us to understand the current COVID-19 pandemic.
