Economy and public health in the Basque Country in times of the Spanish influenza
Abstract:
The Spanish influenza pandemic highlighted the limitations of the public health and
social protection system in the Basque Country. The deficiencies of the liberal health

and social protection system prevented the articulation of a comprehensive and effec-
tive response to the major health and social crisis caused by the pandemic. In addi-
tion to examining the general economic context and the administrative framework for

health and social protection at the time in the Basque Country, the main objective of

the article is to analyse and evaluate the response articulated by the basque public ad-
ministrations to the Spanish influenza pandemic. The analysis will be based mainly on

the budgetary analysis of the information collected in the territorial archives of √Ålava,
Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa.
