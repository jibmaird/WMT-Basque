The Spanish flu in Bilbao. Demographic analysis of the pandemic and its conse-
quences from different information sources

Abstract:
The objective of this study is the analysis of the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1920 in
the city of Bilbao. The capital of Biscay reaches high mortality rates as a result of the
Spanish flu. From a demographic perspective, various aspects related to the pandemic
have been analyzed: On the one hand, the different sources of information available at
the time, the Civil Registry and the Statistical Bulletin of Bilbao, have been studied. The
data provided by both sources have been compared and the differences have been
explained. The different possible methodologies in the study of the pandemic have

also been analyzed: The study of direct deaths from influenza, pneumonia and bron-
chopneumonia and the study of excess mortality. On the other hand, the population

effects of the Spanish flu in the capital of Biscay have been described, especially the
differences in mortality by the age or the sex of the deceased, or the direct relationship
with crude birth rates.
