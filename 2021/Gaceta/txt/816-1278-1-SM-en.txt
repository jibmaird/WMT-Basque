The Spanish Influenza in the Basque Country and the world
Abstract:
At the beginning of the First World War, the population of the world was 1,825,000,000.
During the Spanish flu pandemic (1918-1920), half of the world’s population became ill,
with about 40 million people dying, which is 2.5% of all the world’s inhabitants. The Spanish
flu pandemic killed, in Europe, 4 million people, which is 1.1% of its total population. The

southern countries had higher rates of excess mortality (e.g. Italy 15.1 deaths per 1000 inha-
bitants) than the northern countries of the continent (e.g. Norway 5.6 deaths per 1000 inha-
bitants). By age, the most affected population group was young adults. Of the 4 or 5 waves it

had, the most serious was the second (autumn 1918), with most of the deaths concentrated
in the months of October and November 1918.
In the Basque Country, slightly more than 15,000 people died, which means a rate of 12.1
deaths per 1000 inhabitants, with great variations from one town to another. A significant
percentage were young adults, since 55.8% of all those who died were between 15 and 44
years old. Men accounted for 53.0% and women for 47.0%. The average age of the deceased
diagnosed with flu was 28 years. The peak of deaths occurred in October 1918.
