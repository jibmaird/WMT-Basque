Brief visual tour of the 1918-20 flu pandemic
Abstract:
As a way of visually complementing this book, a selection of photographic images
that captured the influenza pandemic of 1918 is shown. Without pretending to be an

exhaustive review on the subject, it is worth noting the scarce number of images co-
llected in our immediate environment, as well as note that a large number of them,

coinciding with the current covid-19 pandemic, have been repeated. in a multiplicity of
publications, becoming iconographic references of the time. Similarly, it is also easy to
find, among them, other pictures falsely attributed to those years.
