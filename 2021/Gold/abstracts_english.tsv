doc1	1	A study of Parkinson´s Disease’s clinical biomarkers from an epidemiological view
doc1	2	Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a movement-related neurodegenerative disorder.
doc1	3	The overall prevalence of PD in the total population is around 0,1-0,3% and its etiology is hitherto unknown.
doc1	4	Even if the disease has classically been defined as a pure motor movement disorder, non-motor symptoms (NMS), such as disautonomic, sensorial, emotional and sleeping disturbances, are also frequent in the earliest stages of the disease.
doc1	5	Due to their early presentation, these NMS may serve as useful clinical biomarkers.
doc1	6	Genetic forms are responsible of 15% of PD cases. Missense mutations in LRRK2 were first identified as a cause of PD in 2004 and nowadays are known to be the main factor in contributing to the genetic development of PD.
doc1	7	One of these mutations seemed to be especially frequent in population of Basque ascent.
doc1	8	With the aim of assessing the disease prevalence in the area, an epidemiological study was conducted in 2009 within the communities of Azkoitia and Azpeitia.
doc1	9	Not only was the prevalence studied but also the appearance of NMS as possible biomarkers of PD was analyzed.
doc1	10	Based on this, we thought that it would be interesting to study the same population sample that was previously analyzed in 2009, 10 years after. The purpose was to determine the relevance of age, NMS and environmental factors on PD development.
doc1	11	In this study, which has been a Final Degree Project in Medicine, it has been possible to collect information from 173 of the 232 people who participated in 2009.
doc1	12	According to the results, there was an increment of PD along with the increase of the sample’s average age.
doc1	13	Besides, the REM sleep behaviour disorder appears to be the most significant clinical biomarker of PD as well as the most meaningful risk factor to develop PD in the near future.
doc1	14	All these outcomes need to be treated with some caution due to the reduced size of the sample analyzed.
doc2	1	Activation of specialized care in Basque in the Integrated Health Organization Barrualde-Galdakao from Osakidetza
doc2	2	In 2015 we began to register the linguistic choice of the citizens of our region, that is, the language in which they wanted to communicate orally in the healthcare activity.
doc2	3	From the first moment, we clearly saw that, based on the linguistic competence of our professionals, we had to reorganize our human resources in order to offer healthcare, according to the linguistic choice of the citizen.
doc2	4	And so we have done, starting in Primary Care and continuing in Specialized Care.
doc2	5	As of today we can affirm that we have a wide active fixed offer of external consultations for specialized care in Basque.

doc5	2	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main cause of mortality worldwide, and is heavily related to diet and sedentary lifestyle.
doc5	3	However, it can also be developed due to genetic factors.
doc5	4	Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common inherited autosomic disease mainly related to mutations in 3 different genes.
doc5	5	FH is associated with high plasma LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels that increase the risk of suffering from CVD.
doc5	6	This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on FH related genetic factors, disease diagnosis, treatment and the involvement of FH in the development of CVD.
doc6	1	Importance of nutrition in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: nutritional care
doc6	2	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease of the human motor system that causes progressive loss of brain and spinal cord motoneurons.
doc6	3	Suffering from ALS has a direct negative effect on the patient's nutritional status.
doc6	4	Malnutrition is widespread in patients with ALS. Malnutrition affects muscular strength and immunity, leading to the progression of disease and death.
doc6	5	Several clinical trials have shown that malnutrition is an independent predictive factor.
doc6	6	Therefore, it is important to have an early and periodic nutritional assessment in patients with ALS to adapt iin every moment patient’s diet to their clinical condition.
doc7	1	Gullo´s Syndrome (Benign Pancreatic Hyperenzymemia): Report of the First Two Cases in Basque Country
doc7	2	Gullo´s syndrome is a benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia that appears in healthy individuals and that it maintained over time, with fluctuations and transient normalization of pancreatic enzyme values in the absence of any evidence of clinical or morphological pancreatic disease.
doc7	3	Its correct diagnosis is important to assure the carriers of the defect that there is no pancreas disease and to avoid unnecessary examinations, treatments and hospitalizations.
doc8	1	Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) as a form of presentation of a small cell carcinoma of the lung
doc8	2	Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) , previously known as oat cell carcinoma, constitutes about 15 to 20% of lung cancers.
doc8	3	Compared to other solid tumors, small cell lung carcinoma is one of the fastest growing tumor and it has a greater tendency to develop distant metastasis earlier.
doc8	4	Local symptoms include cough, dyspnea, thoracic pain, wheezing or atelectasis.
doc8	5	In regards to distant metastasis, the most common organs to be affected are bone, liver, and brain.
doc8	6	On the other hand, also highlight the fact that it is one of the solid tumors that most often produce paraneoplastic syndromes like cushing syndrome, SIADH, or Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.
doc8	7	The following is an interesting case of a patient that was hospitalized in our service because of a severe hyponatremia due to SIADH. The purpose is to outline the possible diagnosis of having small cell lung carcinoma.

doc11	1	Psychological improvement of over 55 years old students that attend the university for older people at the University of the Basque Country
doc11	2	Increased longevity is a worldwide phenomena.
doc11	3	As people live more, it is necessary to ensure a satisfying and healthy life for them.
doc11	4	There is a higher amount of people out of the working life and there is a need of choices to spend the leisure time and there is a need of social inclusion.
doc11	5	The aim of the study was to measure the emotional condition in a group of elderly students, basing on the hypothesis of which these persons improve in this aspect thanks to the effect that produces in them the experience of the University for people aged over 55 years in the University of the Basque Country.
doc11	6	63 people, over 55 years old students attending the University of the Basque Country, were evaluated using the the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI).
doc11	7	Socio-demographic data were also collected.
doc11	8	So, as life expectancy is increasing, population ageing is a major global trend and there is a need for transforming economies and societies around the world.
doc11	9	We think it is important to continue creating resources for old people since most of them at retirement age still have very good physical and psychological health.
doc11	10	Isolation and mental health problems must also be addressed to ensure that they have a good quality of life.
doc12	1	The patient in peritoneal dialysis
doc13	1	Study of vitamin D levels in different populations
doc13	2	Numerous studies have shown a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in both healthy population and patients with different diseases.
doc13	3	In addition, vitamin D deficiency is considered to have a great impact in the evolution of these diseases.
doc13	4	The main aim of this study is to measure vitamin D levels in three different populations (healthy young students, patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism and patients with bone and joint infection), and to compare the obtained results with previously published studies.
doc13	5	A total of 260 participants were included: 100 healthy young students, 125 hypothyroid patients and 35 patients with bone and joint infections.
doc13	6	The prevalence of vitamin D (25(OH)D) sufficiency (≥ 30 ng/ml), insufficiency (21-29 ng/ml) and deficiency (≤20 ng/ml) was evaluated.
doc13	7	While 15.4% of the studied subjects were vitamin D sufficient, 43.1% were insufficient and 41.5% were deficient.
doc13	8	The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the healthy student’s group was 21%, it increased to 49.6% in the group of patients with hypothyroidism and added up to 62.9% in the ones with bone and joint infections.
doc13	9	The research proved that only 22% of the healthy young people, 12.8% of the hypothyroid patients and 2.9% of the patients with bone and joint infection had sufficient levels of vitamin D.
doc13	10	The prevalence of deficient and insufficient vitamin D levels was very high in each study group, similar to those in previously published studies.
doc13	11	Our data strongly suggest that vitamin D levels should be measured in the population at risk of vitamin D deficiency (such as patients with bone and joint infection and patients with hypothyroidism), and that vitamin D-enriched food should be promoted for the general population.

doc18	1	Taxus baccata intoxication
doc18	2	Taxus baccata is one of the most poisonous trees in the world.
doc18	3	It contains taxanes and toxic alkaloids: the most dangerous one is the taxine.
doc18	4	It is a fairly common plant in our environment and could be extremely dangerous; however, yew poisoning is quite rare.
doc18	5	Cases may occur by voluntary or accidental form.
doc18	6	Therefore, the rapid orientation and diagnosis of suspected episodes are important, in order to treat it quickly.
doc18	7	A man was transferred to the hospital with no symptoms after autolytic attempt by abundant yew leaves ingestion.
doc18	8	He presented respiratory alkalosis, reduced consciousness and ventricular tachycardia.
doc18	9	He was treated urgently and fully recovered in a week.
doc18	10	There are no specific analytical alterations in this intoxication.
doc18	11	Taxine compound analysis is not made in clinical laboratories.
doc18	12	The final diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of 3,5-dimethoxyphenol (a taxine metabolite), by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

doc19	1	Pregnancy and lactation-related breast pathology review
doc19	2	The aim of this review is to discuss both the clinical and the radiological appearance, as well as the best therapeutic options, regarding the commonest breast-pathology related to pregnancy and lactation.
doc19	3	Important hormonal changes happen during pregnancy and lactation.
doc19	4	These variations will cause physiological changes on different body organs, including the breast tissue, where not only physiologic changes but also pathology can occur.
doc19	5	Breast-pathology related to pregnancy and breastfeeding is benign in most cases and needs no further study, galactocele, infectious mastitis, fibroadenoma and lactation-related adenoma being some of the commonest diagnoses.
doc19	6	It is mandatory for any radiologist to be familiar with these terms, since despite their benign nature some of them need to exclude malignancy during the diagnostic process.
doc19	7	Most of the cases are diagnosed in symptomatic patients, new-onset breast lump being the most frequent symptom.
doc19	8	Breast ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice during these periods, while the other imaging techniques will be used on a second-time basis only when information provided by the ultrasound examination is insufficient.
doc19	9	Pregnancy-associated breast-cancer is the most frequent malignancy during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Despite not being as frequent as the previously mentioned benign pathology, its early diagnosis is essential in order to let the oncologic committee ensure the earliest and best medical attention for the patient.
doc20	1	The latest steps in antidepressant treatment: present and future
doc20	2	Depression is among the most common psychiatric diseases in today’s society, and its incidence is steadily increasing.
doc20	3	Many theories have attempted to explain depression’s origin and etiology, but various aspects of its neurobiology are still unknown.
doc20	4	The most relevant hipotesis of depression are the monoaminergic, the neurotrophic and the neuroinflammatory, and this review discusses their origin, evidence and features, along with a few other theories’.
doc20	5	In the past, antidepressant drug discovery happened by chance, and the study of effective substances at improving symptoms contributed greatly to the knowledge of the neurobiology of depression.
doc20	6	Classical antidepressants constitute the base of the pharmacological treatment of depression: monoaminoxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine reuptake inhibitors.
doc20	7	Newer drugs, like trazodone and mirtazapine, possess a more complex pharmacodynamic profile.
doc20	8	With the aim to avoid their usual adverse effects, and to improve their effectiveness, alternative mechanisms have been explored. This research has resulted in the discovery of substances such as agomelatine, tianeptine and vortioxetine, but their use and efficacy are not very widespread.
doc20	9	Nonetheless, ketamine has recently revolutionised the research of antidepressants, since it has proven to be a fast-acting, potent antidepressant, even in resistant cases, in addition to being safe and well-tolerated.
doc20	10	Lastly, psychedelic substances have been known to improve symptoms of a variety of psychiatric diseases, including depression.
doc20	11	Specifically psilocybin has shown great prospects as an antidepressant in a number of studies. Despite its undeniable beneficial effects on depressed patients, its antidepressant mechanisms are not entirely clear, and research in the field is currently trending.
doc21	1	Effect of exercise on cognitive and physical function in institutionalized older adults with cognitive impairment: systematic review
doc21	2	In recent years, the prevalence of cognitive impairment has increased among the elderly, becoming one of the main reasons for suffering dependency and being institutionalized.
doc21	3	Previously in the literature it has been reported that exercise induces improvements on cognitive and physical function in older adults with cognitive impairment.
doc21	4	However, there is no consensus regarding the appropriate exercise type to approach those improvements.
doc21	5	Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review regarding the effects of exercise on cognitive function of institutionalized older adults with cognitive impairment.
doc21	6	In addition, a second aim was to evaluate the effects of exercise in physical function.
doc21	7	To achieve this aim a systematic review of clinical trials was performed on the Pubmed database.
doc21	8	Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale.
doc21	9	A total of 7 studies were analyzed.
doc21	10	In all the analyzed studies the intervention group performed aerobic or multicomponent exercises.
doc21	11	As regards to cognitive function while significant improvements were observed in 3 studies, in other 3 studies cognitive function did not change. Besides, a cognitive decline was observed in the intervention group in one study.
doc21	12	Concerning physical function, results were heterogeneous.
doc21	13	Exercise has a positive effect on cognitive function in older adults with cognitive impairment although the cognitive impairment level affects the proportion of its benefits.
doc21	14	Similarly, exercise seems to improve physical function although in most of the studies these results are not statistically significant.

doc27	1	Nicolás Achúcarro Lund: a biographical sketch of the first basque neuroscientist
doc27	2	We wrote a brief biography of Nicolás Achúcarro Lund. Achúcarro was a medical doctor born in Bilbao.
doc27	3	Many consider him the first Basque neuroscientist or, at least, the first neuroscientist of said region to have had an extensive international projection.
doc27	4	In this paper we look into different aspects and chapters of his life: his family, his first studies, his medical degree, the neuropsychiatric specialization, his American stage, his professional return to Spain, his illness and death, and his posthumous recognitions.
doc28	1	The american stage of Nicolás Achúcarro: histopathologist at Saint Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D. C. (1908-1910)
doc28	2	In September 1908, the Basque neuropsychiatrist Nicolas Achúcarro moved from the Psychiatric Clinic of Munich to the Government Hospital for the Insane in Washington, D. C. with the task to organize and head the new histopathology laboratory.
doc28	3	With an abundance of resources and full freedom to work, he launched the histopathological laboratory, and contributed a series of articles to the hospital Bulletin, which earned him a solid scientific reputation.
doc28	4	Achúcarro stayed in Washington until May 14, 1910, when he resigned his position and moved to Madrid, to work with Santiago Ramón y Cajal in his laboratory of biological research.
doc28	5	Later, in September 1912, he was invited by the Fordham University of New York to teach in the International Extension Course in Medical and Nervous Diseases, together with the English neurologist Henry Head and the Swiss psychoanalyst Carl G. Jung, among other prominent figures.
doc28	6	Drawing on the writings of Achúcarro, letters to his family, and the press of the time, this paper analyzes his work in the United States as well as his contributions to neuroscience before his untimely death in 1918 at the young age of 37.

doc30	4	At first, the acutely alienated were barred from entering the then Achuri General Hospital, being sent to one of the prisons in Bilbao, along with beggars, criminals, and prostitutes.
doc30	5	"If their state of illness maintained, the absence of an institution for ""insane"" in the territory, forced the hospitalization in other provinces, far away from their family and friends, from which, sooner or later, they were totally uprooted given the long stays, even for decades."
doc30	6	A provincial madhouse was a long-standing aspiration, which finally never came to completion in its entirety, with partial responses such as the Bermeo hospital in 1900, or later the old spa of Zaldibar, “provisionally” dedicated to hospital purposes from 1923.
doc30	7	Since then, there have been several attempts to take up the matter of the provincial madhouse, with some scandals and complaints even from outside, forming a surprising succession of multiple proposals and failed projects until the last third of the 20th century.
doc30	8	Among many others, the most ambitious project was the one promoted in the early 1930s, where a macro hospital complex was planned to welcome 1,300-1,500 patients and was finally transferred in 1951 to the Bishopric of Bilbao, for seminar purposes.
doc30	9	It was in the late 1960s that a new psychiatric clinic project materialized, the current Zamudio Hospital of the Bizkaia Mental Health Network, Osakidetza.

doc37	1	Epidemiological, clinical and microbiological research of genital herpes in the area of Bilbao
doc37	2	Genital herpes (GH) is a major public health problem.
doc37	3	According to the latest estimates of seroprevalence of WHO there were 500 million people worldwide with two types of herpes simplex virus (HSV) genital infection.
doc37	4	In recent decades there has been a clear increase of GH caused by HSV type 1, especially in young women.
doc37	5	The objective of this study was to analyze the proportion of HSV types 1 and 2 in genital infections and the epidemiological, clinical and therapeutics characteristics of the patients with GH.
doc37	6	Epidemiological retrospective study from STD clinic patients with GH of Bilbo-Basurto integrated health organization during years 2004–2015.
doc37	7	According to the results obtained, the proportion of patients with GH increased during the study period, especially genital infections by HSV type 1.
doc37	8	These infections were higher among young women, with first episode of GH and prior contact with a partner’s oral-labial herpes, homosexual men and oral sex.
doc37	9	Sexual behaviors associated with HSV type 2 infection were prostitution and prior STD.
doc37	10	An increase in the incidence of genital infections caused by HSV type 1 was found, especially in young women.

doc38	3	Osteoarthritis of the thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) joint remains one of the main reasons for visiting a hand centre.
doc38	4	Whenever the conservative treatment fails, the surgical approach will be offered.
doc38	5	This treatment should be indicated individually for each patient, depending on various factors as the age, the degeneration degree, the functional demand and so on.
doc38	7	The average age of the patients was 53,89 years, with predominance of females (89,28%).
doc38	9	In 11 cases an arthroscopic arthroplasty was performed (ATK), in 11 patients a CMC fusion and in 5 a ligamentoplasty.
doc38	10	Out of the 112 patients, 63 patients have been controlled, with an average F-U of 19.5 months.
doc38	12	Focus on the pain, assessed by the visual analog scale, the improvement was 5.62, 5.98, 6 and 6.33 points respectively, compared to the preoperative situation.
doc38	13	These outcomes confirm the usefulness of the suspension-interposition arthroplasty as an ideal technique for the common patient of CMC arthritis.

doc42	1	The rol of the physical therapists as integrated professional in resuscitation/intensive care units.
doc42	2	In the majority of the developed countries, physical therapists play a very important role within the multidisciplinary teams of intensive care Units (ICU).
doc42	4	However, this is not the case in the Basque Healthcare Service Osakidetza, where there are no physiotherapists whatsoever integrated in resuscitation units.
doc42	5	There is strong evidence of the presence of physical therapists in ICUs having a direct effect on the shortening of the mechanical ventilation time and the hospital stay of patients, resulting in reduced economical expenses for healthcare services.
doc42	7	The rehabilitation of patients in these units requires the acquisition of very specific knowledge in respiratory physiotherapy, as well as good communication skills and technical rigour to ensure maximum quality rehabilitation, always respecting safety parameters and the patient's autonomy principles.

doc43	2	After 100 years of the flu pandemic of 1918, also called the Spanish flu, and in the face of a new viral pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus, it is necessary and timely to carry out an analysis of the main historical milestones of this major disease.
doc43	3	The study of the virus that caused the 1918 flu pandemic has resulted in one of the most exciting stories in modern microbiology.
doc43	4	The objective of this paper is to gain a deeper understanding of the revolutionary research work that led to the discovery, complete genome sequencing, and genetic reconstruction of the 1918 influenza virus, which may help us to understand the current COVID-19 pandemic.
doc44	1	The Spanish Influenza in the Basque Country and the world.
doc44	1	At the beginning of the First World War, the population of the world was 1,825,000,000.
doc44	2	During the Spanish flu pandemic (1918-1920), half of the world’s population became ill, with about 40 million people dying, which is 2.5% of all the world’s inhabitants.
doc44	3	The Spanish flu pandemic killed, in Europe, 4 million people, which is 1.1% of its total population.
doc44	4	The southern countries had higher rates of excess mortality (e.g. Italy 15.1 deaths per 1000 inhabitants) than the northern countries of the continent (e.g. Norway 5.6 deaths per 1000 inhabitants).
doc44	5	By age, the most affected population group was young adults.
doc44	6	Of the 4 or 5 waves it had, the most serious was the second (autumn 1918), with most of the deaths concentrated in the months of October and November 1918.

doc45	4	The capital of Biscay reaches high mortality rates as a result of the Spanish flu.
doc45	5	From a demographic perspective, various aspects related to the pandemic have been analyzed: On the one hand, the different sources of information available at the time, the Civil Registry and the Statistical Bulletin of Bilbao, have been studied.
doc45	6	The data provided by both sources have been compared and the differences have been explained.
doc45	7	The different possible methodologies in the study of the pandemic have also been analyzed: The study of direct deaths from influenza, pneumonia and bronchopneumonia and the study of excess mortality.
doc45	8	On the other hand, the population effects of the Spanish flu in the capital of Biscay have been described, especially the differences in mortality by the age or the sex of the deceased, or the direct relationship with crude birth rates.
doc46	1	The second wave of the 1918 pandemic flu in Irun in the press.
doc46	2	Due to its status as a border city, Irún especially suffered from the 1918 epidemic flu.
doc46	3	Specifically, the second wave, which arrived at its doors from France in September, thanks to the heavy traffic of Portuguese soldiers and seasonal workers.
doc46	4	However, in the local press, initially, the disease has not importance, which occupies minimal space and in areas of less interest until after the death peak, on September 21 and 22.
doc46	5	It is in early October when the pandemic receives the most attention.
doc46	7	The absence of local information about the flu and the concealment of its terrible effects in the city of Irún is striking.
doc46	8	In November, the people most involved in the social and health struggle are thanked for their work, and initiatives are cited to alleviate the effects, but interest in the epidemic soon waned, cornered in the press by the end of the First World War.

doc53	1	Inappropriate prescribing, chronic and on demand, in pluripathological patients aged ≥65 according to STOPP-START criteria.
doc53	2	The pluripathological chronic patients, small percentage of the population, consume a high percentage of health resources and its total expenditure, influencing their polymedication and the problems associated with it.
doc53	3	Objective: To analyze the proportion, characteristics and association with other socio-demographic and clinical variables of the Inappropriate Prescription (IP) in pluripathological patients aged ≥65 in a Primary Health Care Centre, using the STOPP-START criteria and the correct prescription of Proton-Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) guidelines.
doc53	4	Methods: Transversal study of chronic and on demand medication (considering STOPP-START criteria and PPIs guidelines), of the patients of one Primary Health Care Centre included in an institutional program for pluripathological patients.
doc53	5	According to a predictive complexity index based on the Kaiser’s Pyramid, and adding new patients meeting “Ollero criteria” and ≥1 hospital admission during the previous year.
doc53	6	Complementary variables were sociodemographic (gender, age), clinical (Charlson comorbidity Index, number/characteristics of the drugs), and functional (Barthel Index) ones.
doc53	7	Results: The 85% of the patients (with >4 usual drugs) had ≥1 STOPP or START criteria (2015 version), and 29.1% IP considering PPIs.
doc53	8	The most frequent STOPP criterion were aldosterone antagonists with other drugs that raise potassium level (11,5%), NSAIDs in heart failure (10.6%), and the use of ≥2 antimuscarinic/anticholinergics (8.7%).
doc53	9	Moreover, the START pneumococcal (37.3% of 67) and influenza (23.9%) vaccination.
doc53	10	With 2009 criteria, the most common STOPP were NSAIDs in heart failure and benzodiazepines (both 17.2% of 64) and duplicities (7.8%), and the START non-prescribing statins (26% of 23).
doc53	11	Having a STOPP criterion was associated with lower score in the Barthel, and with the total number of medications (both p= 0.02).
doc53	12	Conclusions: STOPP-START criteria are useful to analyze the IP in elderly pluripathological patients, which remains high.
doc53	13	There is a qualitative change and higher capacity detecting IP with the new criteria (2015).
doc54	1	Chagas: an emerging disease.
doc54	2	The Chagas disease or American tripanosomiasis, which is transmited by bugs, is the parasitary disease with the higher tases of morbi-mortality in America.
doc54	3	Due principally to the increase of the migratory dinamics, the disease has spread to non endemic areas.
doc54	4	The goals of this research are to provide an updated view of Chagas disease in the Basque Country and analyze the resource consumption of this health problem.
doc54	5	An observational, descriptive and retrospective study.
doc54	6	The data was obtained from the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS).
doc54	7	Hospital admissions from 2010 to 2015 were collected, with diagnosis of infection by Tripanosoma cruzi in public hospitals of the Basque Country.
doc54	8	The study population was 104 patients, out of a total of 140 admissions.
doc54	9	The variables studied are main and secondary diagnosis, sex, age, country of birth, and province and section of hospital admission.
doc54	10	Regarding diagnosis, 82 have no organ involvement, 15 have cardiac involvement, 5 have involvement of another organ and 2 have cardiac and other organ involvement.
doc54	11	Only in 10 patients Chagas' disease was the main diagnosis.
doc54	12	In 31 women the admission section was Gynecology and Obstetrics.
doc54	13	There is a statistically significant difference between the sexes (85 women and 19 men).
doc54	14	There is no association between sex and Chagas disease with organic involvement.
doc54	15	68 patients are in the age group 30-49 years.
doc54	16	Bolivia is the country of origin of 63 patients.
doc54	17	The total cost of income is 761,636€.
doc54	18	Chagas disease is a global health problem, which is gaining sufficient relevance in our environment.
doc54	19	Therefore, care strategies should be carried out for the detection of new cases and the control and follow-up of diagnosed cases.
doc55	1	Spiritual care at the end of life.
doc55	2	Intervention by health professionals.
doc55	3	This article is about spiritual care at end of life, delving into palliative care.
doc55	4	Spiritual field is important throughout the whole biography, because it supposes an innate and necessary search of the meaning of life.
doc55	5	Nevertheless, it specially takes on importance when death is close and difficult questions come up.
doc55	6	The main goal is to emphasise the importance of spiritual sphere at the end of life and to know the tools for evaluation and treatment of spiritual suffering.
doc55	7	A bibliographic revision was made in different scientific data bases (PubMed, ScienceDirect) about the following issues: Death in actual society and medicine, spiritual needs at end of life, tools for detection, evaluation and treatment.
doc55	8	Quite a lot of tools have been developed for detection, evaluation and treatment of spiritual needs, but education and awareness is needed among professionals.
doc55	9	Amongst these tools the one proposed by GES stands out.
doc55	10	It is a simple, short and sensitive survey for evaluating spiritual sphere, which has also a therapeutic use.
doc55	11	Working on this field is beneficial for the patient if it is done in individualised way.
doc55	12	Highlight is made on working on the process of dying in actual society, with a direct effect on assistance at the end of life.
doc55	13	Considering spiritual needs that appear in this last phase is needed to offer integral assistance.
doc55	14	Education is required in this process.
doc56	1	Contribution of the medicinal use of cannabis derivatives: a review of their potential clinical efficacy and risks.
doc56	2	The use of cannabis derivatives as therapeutic agents raises today a broad scientific and social debate.
doc56	3	There are some synthetic cannabis derivatives approved by drug regulatory agencies with clinical indications such as nausea and vomiting in cancer patients, or pain treatment among the most important.
doc56	4	The objective of the work is the review, based on current scientific knowledge, of the potential therapeutic use, in terms of clinical efficacy and safety, of cannabis derivatives in different clinical situations, especially associated with the treatment of pain, basic treatment and / or coadjuvant in cancerous processes, as well as treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases.
doc56	5	For all these areas, at the present time, clinical research on the use of natural or synthetic cannabis derivatives is scarce, so it is recommended to promote it with controlled clinical studies according to the regulations of international drug regulatory agencies.
doc56	6	It should be studies that, in addition to providing knowledge on the efficacy and safety of these products, demonstrate the most effective form of administration for therapeutic use, the most appropriate active components (Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol), and the clinical impact of its association with other drugs.
doc56	7	In conclusion, only the increase in scientific knowledge of the therapeutic properties of cannabis derivatives can help their legalization for medicinal purposes.

doc60	2	We presently consider the Bill of Organic Law on Regulation of Euthanasia, which was put forward by the Parliamentary Group of the Socialist Party and published in the Official Gazette of the Spanish Parliament on 21st May 2018, appropriate as a whole, in the light of the experience of those countries in our cultural environment where legislation on Physician Assistance in Dying has been adopted.
doc60	3	We also regard its approach to certain aspects of the subject matter as correct, in order to avoid the problems already arisen in the countries mentioned when their laws were enforced.
doc60	4	However, we do make a number of objections to its terminology, and a question of procedure should be addressed.
doc61	1	Role of butyric acid in food and intestinal health
doc61	2	Butyric acid is a short chain fatty acid that contains 6 carbon atoms.
doc61	3	It is found naturally in the digestive tract and its use in pathologies with intestinal involvement.
doc61	4	It is the main energy substrate of the enterocyte and stimulates the absorption of sodium and water in the colon and presents trophic action in the intestinal cells.
doc61	5	Its properties and the role it plays in the gastrointestinal tract, have been known since ancient times; however, recent research shows that it remains a molecule with great potential.
doc62	1	The importance of nutritional treatment in the different units of eating disorders
doc62	2	The Eating Disorders they are mental problems, they are manifested mainly through food.
doc62	3	Eating disorders such as Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa are health problems that have caused some alarm and concern in our society in recent years, which is why the World Health Organization has placed the Eating Disorders among mental illnesses of priority given the health risk they imply.
doc62	4	The treatment of these diseases is based on the coordinated participation of multidisciplinary teams, in which the nutritional treatment carried out by the dietitian-nutritionist plays an important role.
doc62	5	This treatment is carried out in three different units: outpatient, day hospital and hospitalization.
doc62	6	Depending on the condition of the patient, the treatment will be carried out in one unit or another.
doc62	7	Patients suffering from malnutrition or severe malnutrition are at risk of developing refeeding syndrome, so the dietitian-nutritionist should treat these patients with special attention.
doc62	8	Education from the university to dietetics and nutrition professionals in the treatment of these diseases can improve the quality of life and the future of these patients.
doc63	1	Surgical management of the nail injuries
doc63	2	Nail injuries management is often unknown and underestimated at the emergency departments (A&E), due to their banality and to the lack of knowledge of the nail anatomy.

doc69	3	Its cause is idiopathic; however it is a widely held view that there may be genetic factors involved.
doc69	4	X-ray tests showing vertebral wedging and kyphotic angulation of the thoracic spine accompanied by compatible symptoms are usually evident enough to formulate a diagnosis.
doc70	1	Charles Bonnet syndrome; About a case
doc70	2	We report the case of a 98 year-old-female patient treated at our health centre whose main symptom was the presence of isolated visual hallucinations.
doc70	3	The patient preserved insight of its symptoms since they have started, being conscious about its irreality but able to describe them with absolutely precision referring to facial expression of people visualized and its costumes.
doc70	5	Dementia syndrome was ruled out, and Charles Bonnet Syndrome, consisting of the appearance of visual hallucinations secondary to severe visual impairment, was considered instead.
doc70	6	This shows the need to consider Charles Bonnet Syndrome in the differential diagnosis of visual hallucinations in elderly patients in primary health care and indeed adaptation of test and complementary studies to reach it.

doc72	2	To assess the diagnostic accuracy of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in the management of indeterminate renal cystic lesions identified by ultrasound or Computed Tomography (CT).
doc72	4	All underwent an additional CEUS.
doc72	5	The parameters required for the Bosniak classification system were recorded, classifying the lesions in benign (Bosniak I, II, IIF) or malignant (III, IV, solid lesions).
doc72	6	The diagnostic accuracy of each technique (sensitivity (TPR), specificity (TNR), positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV)) were calculated, choosing P<0.05 as significance limit.
doc72	8	Unenhanced ultrasound showed values of TPR 60%, TNR 80%, PPV 55,4% y NPV 82,8%.
doc72	9	Contrast enhanced ultrasound presented values of TPR 94%, TNR 97,6%, PPV 99,5% y NPV 77,6%.
doc72	10	As an additional analysis of the CEUS group, in <3cm (n=34) obtained TPR 100% and TNR 100%.
doc72	11	In the subgroup of >=3cm (n=24), the ECC had an TPR 75% and TNR E95% with a PPV of 86'1% and NPV of 90'2%.
doc72	12	Of the 58 studied indeterminate cystic renal lesions, 41 (70,7%) were benign while 17 (29,3%) turned out to be kidney tumors.
doc72	13	CEUS is an accurate and useful technique in indeterminate cystic lesions identified by CT or unhencanced ultrasound.
doc72	14	The results of complex cystic lesions smaller than 3 cm are promising, and can show a greater utility in these patients, although more studies are needed.
